# Training exercise: Playing with .txt
### *A traning exercise using C for subject Operating Systems at UFRR college*

<br/>

This .c algorithm has four main functions: `line_read_file`, `specific_line`, `rename_file` and `trunc_delete_file`.
- `line_read_file`: Print all .txt lines (line by line)
- `specific_line`: Print just one specific line
- `rename_file`: Rename the file
- `trunc_delete_file`: First truncate the .txt and next delete it
